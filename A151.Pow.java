/**
Implement pow(x, n). Pow(x,n) returns the value of x^n.


Idea:
It's not a hard problem, but impelemnt the best solution in a short time requires some thinking.
Notice that in this pow method, x is a double and n is an Integer. So n must be positive int, negative int
or zero, n could not have any decimal digits, we don't need to consider that.

Then we have two edge cases:
1, when x is 0, no matter what n is, return 0.
2, when n is 0, no matter what x is, return 1.


Solution1: Naive solution
If n is a positive Integer, we need to simply mutiply x for n times. (1*x*x....*x) 
If n is a negative Integer, we use x to divide 1 for n times. (1/x/x..../x)
Also we need to handle the above two edge cases. 
Although this method works, the running time is not good enough. We surely can do better
than this.

Time Complexity: O(n)


Solution2: Recursive solution
There is a very obvious relationship between pow(x,n) and pow(x,n/2).
If n%2 ==0, no matter n>0 or n<0, then pow(x,n) = pow(x,n/2)*pow(x,n/2).
If n%2 ==1, and n>0, then pow(x,n) = pow(x,n/2)*pow(x,n/2)*x
If n%2 ==1, and n<0, then pow(x,n) = pow(x,n/2)*pow(x,n/2)/x
Using this relationship, we can divide and conquer this problem. In each pass, we can
reduce half the size of this problem to n/2. Then get a much better running time.

Note that we can use n%2 to determine if n is greater than 0, if n%2>0, then n>0.
The second state edge case is actually the bace case for this recursion:
If we keep dividing this problem, at the end n would be 0, then we just return 1.
Also we need to handle the edge case when x is 0, we always return 0.

Time complexity: O(logn)  same as binary search
